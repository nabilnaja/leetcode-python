#### 78. Subsets

* Description

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

* Complexity analysis

Time complexity: O(n * 2 ^ n). there is 2 ^ n solutions and we have to copy each one in the solutions array

Space complexity: O(n).
